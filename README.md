# VIA-Technologies-Intern-2024-Project
2025 VIA Technologies Edge AI Intern code for performing plant leaf detection, segmentation, and disease detection 
for Debian AI Transforma boards. 

## Visualizing Results with leaf_detect_segment.py
leaf_detect_segment.py contains code for testing disease detection, and image masking accuracy on several different image sources,
such as plant village or images taken of real plants in the office. 

When the plant is healthy, YOLO detects the leaf, and we draw a green bounding box and mask using image segmentation on the area that is a leaf. 
When a plant has a disease, the mask is red.
